!!! when nft bought the UI should refresh the card to say Your NFT
!!! when you click on a NFT card that you dont own it shouldnt right away call the buy function, but show a modal that shows more details about the nft and then a buy button
!!! all the input fields should have a filter and error messages if the user inputs something unexpected, like wrong length of addresses, space, ... 
!!! how does the price frontend input field interpret . and , ? put in some safety mechanism that the nft doesnt accidentally get listed to a not intended price
!!! add bot protection, so there scalper bots cant directly buy nfts when they have just been listed (to protect against scalpers and also give the user time to review their listing)
